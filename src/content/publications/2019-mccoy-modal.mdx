abstract: Drawing together the metaphysics of counterfactuals with empirical
  work on intuitive judgments, this chapter discusses the nature of
  counterfactual reasoning about self-involving possibilities. It argues that
  when a person reasons about her self-involving possibilities, especially
  far-fetched possibilities, this reasoning may be supported by an underlying
  “self simulator,” a kind of mental engine with an approximate understanding of
  who she is, which enables her to learn about her preferences and make
  intuitive judgments and predictions about her self-involving possibilities. On
  this view, through observing or simulating their own choices, people
  understand themselves through a process similar to that by which they
  understand other people. In this way, they learn about their own beliefs and
  desires. The argument is informed by empirical data from surveys where lay
  people and philosophers decided what action they would take in vignettes
  involving a potentially transformative decision.
