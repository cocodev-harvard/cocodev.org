abstract: How do people hold others responsible for the consequences of their
  actions? We propose a computational model that attributes responsibility as a
  function of what the observed action reveals about the person, and the causal
  role that the person’s action played in bringing about the outcome. The model
  first infers what type of person someone is from having observed their action.
  It then compares a prior expectation of how a person would behave with a
  posterior expectation after having observed the person’s action. The model
  predicts that a person is blamed for negative outcomes to the extent that the
  posterior expectation is lower than the prior, and credited for positive
  outcomes if the posterior is greater than the prior. We model the causal role
  of a person’s action by using a counterfactual model that considers how close
  the action was to having been pivotal for the outcome. The model captures
  participants’ responsibility judgments to a high degree of quantitative
  accuracy across three experiments that cover a range of different situations.
  It also solves an existing puzzle in the literature on the relationship
  between action expectations and responsibility judgments. Whether an
  unexpected action yields more or less credit depends on whether the action was
  diagnostic for good or bad future performance.
