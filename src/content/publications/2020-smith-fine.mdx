abstract: "We are surprised when events violate our intuitive physical
  expectations. Even infants look longer when things seem to magically teleport
  or vanish. This important surprise signal has been used to probe what infants
  expect, in order to study the most basic representations of objects. But these
  studies rely on binary measures â€“ an event is surprising, or not. Here, we
  study surprise in a more precise, quantitative way, using three distinct
  measures: we ask adults to judge *how* surprising a scene is, *when* that
  scene is surprising, and *why* it is surprising. We find good consistency in
  the level of surprise reported across these experiments, but also crucial
  differences in the implied explanations of those scenes. Beyond this, we show
  that the timing and degree of surprise can be explained by an object-based
  model of intuitive physics."
