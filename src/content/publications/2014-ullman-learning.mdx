abstract: Humans acquire their most basic physical concepts early in
  development, but continue to enrich and expand their intuitive physics
  throughout life as they are exposed to more and varied dynamical environments.
  We introduce a hierarchical Bayesian framework to explain how people can learn
  physical theories across multiple timescales and levels of abstraction. In
  contrast to previous Bayesian models of theory acquisition, we work with more
  expressive probabilistic program representations suitable for learning the
  forces and properties that govern how objects interact in dynamic scenes
  unfolding over time. We compare our model and human learners on a challenging
  task of inferring novel physical laws in microworlds given short movies.
  People are generally able to perform this task and behave in line with model
  predictions. Yet they also make systematic errors suggestive of how a top-down
  Bayesian approach to learning might be complemented by a more bottom-up
  feature-based approximate inference scheme, to best explain theory learning at
  an algorithmic level.
