abstract: "We were encouraged by the broad enthusiasm for building machines that
  learn and think in more human-like ways. Many commentators saw our set of key
  ingredients as helpful, but there was disagreement regarding the origin and
  structure of those ingredients. Our response covers three main dimensions of
  this disagreement: nature versus nurture, coherent theories versus theory
  fragments, and symbolic versus sub-symbolic representations. These dimensions
  align with classic debates in artificial intelligence and cognitive science,
  although, rather than embracing these debates, we emphasize ways of moving
  beyond them. Several commentators saw our set of key ingredients as incomplete
  and offered a wide range of additions. We agree that these additional
  ingredients are important in the long run and discuss prospects for
  incorporating them. Finally, we consider some of the ethical questions raised
  regarding the research program as a whole."
