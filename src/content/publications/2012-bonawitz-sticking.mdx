abstract: "An intuitive theory is a system of abstract concepts and laws
  relating those concepts that together provide a framework for explaining some
  domain of phenomena. Constructing an intuitive theory based on observing the
  world, as in building a scientific theory from data, confronts learners with a
  “chicken-and-egg” problem: the laws can only be expressed in terms of the
  theory’s core concepts, but these concepts are only meaningful in terms of the
  role they play in the theory’s laws; how is a learner to discover appropriate
  concepts and laws simultaneously, knowing neither to begin with? Even knowing
  the number of categories in a theory does not resolve this problem: without
  knowing how individuals should be sorted (which categories each belongs to), a
  the causal relationships between categories cannot be resolved. We explore how
  children can solve this chicken-and-egg problem in the domain of magnetism,
  drawing on perspectives from history of science, computational modeling, and
  behavioral experiments. We present preschoolers with a simplified magnet
  learning task and show how our empirical results can be explained as rational
  inferences within a Bayesian computational framework."
