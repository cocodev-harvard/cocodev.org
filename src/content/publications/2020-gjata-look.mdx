abstract: When we reason about the goals of others, how do we balance the
  positive outcomes that actions led to, with the potentially bad ways those
  actions could have ended? In a four-part experiment, we tested whether and how
  adults (full study) and 6- to 8-year-old children (ongoing study) expect other
  agents to take account of the ways their goal-directed action could have
  failed. Across 4 different tasks, we found that adults expected others to
  negatively appraise perilous situations (deep trenches), to minimize the
  danger of their actions, and to trade off danger and reward in their action
  plans. Our preliminary children’s study shows similar trends. These results
  suggest that people appeal to peril — how badly things could go if one’s
  actions fail — when explaining and predicting other people’s actions, and also
  make quantitative inferences that are finely tuned to the degree of peril and
  reward that others face.
