abstract: Models of learning concepts or theories often invoke a stochastic
  search process, in which learners generate hypotheses through some structured
  random process and then evaluate them on some data measuring their quality or
  value. To be successful within a reasonable time-frame, these models need ways
  of generating good candidate hypotheses before the data are considered. Schulz
  (2012a) has proposed that studying the origins of new ideas in more everyday
  contexts, such as how we think up new names for things, can provide insight
  into the cognitive processes that generate good hypotheses for learning. We
  propose a simple generative model for how people might draw on their
  experience to propose new names in everyday domains such as pub names or
  action movies, and show that it captures surprisingly well the names that
  people actually imagine. We discuss the role for an analogous
  hypothesis-generation mechanism in enabling and constraining causal theory
  learning.
