abstract: "We consider an approach to blame attribution based on counterfactual
  reasoning in probabilistic generative models. In this view, people intervene
  on each variable within their model and assign blame in proportion to how much
  a change to a variable would have improved the outcome. This approach raises
  two questions: First, what structure do people use to represent a given
  situation? Second, how do they choose what alternatives to consider when
  intervening on an event? We use a series of coin-tossing scenarios to compare
  empirical data to different models within the proposed framework. The results
  suggest that people sample their intervention values from a prior rather than
  deterministically switching the value of a variable. The results further
  suggest that people represent scenarios differently when asked to reason about
  their own blame attributions, compared with the blame attributions they
  believe others will assign."
