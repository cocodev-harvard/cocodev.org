abstract: Humans have an intuitive understanding of physics. They can predict
  how a physical scene will unfold, and reason about how it came to be. Adults
  may rely on such a physical representation for visual reasoning and
  recognition, going beyond visual features and capturing objects in terms of
  their physical properties. Recently, the use of draped objects in recognition
  was used to examine adult object representations in the absence of many common
  visual features. In this paper we examine young children's reasoning about
  draped objects in order to examine the develop of physical object
  representation. In addition, we argue that a better understanding of the
  development of the concept of cloth as a physical entity is worthwhile in and
  of itself, as it may form a basic ontological category in intuitive physical
  reasoning akin to liquids and solids. We use two experiments to investigate
  young children's (ages 3--5) reasoning about cloth-covered objects, and find
  that they perform significantly above chance (though far from perfectly)
  indicating a representation of physical objects that can interact dynamically
  with the world. Children's success and failure pattern is similar across the
  two experiments, and we compare it to adult behavior. We find a small effect,
  which suggests the specific features that make reasoning about certain objects
  more difficult may carry into adulthood
