abstract: Deciding to undergo a transformative experience present unique
  challenges for a reasonable decision-maker, and for any attempt to give a
  formal account of how people can make such decisions. This chapter focuses on
  the challenges of novelty and change. It develops a normative hierarchical
  model for decision-making over novel objects, and show how it captures the
  commonsense intuition that we can rationally decide to try a new experience,
  but also that such decisions can be graded in difficulty. It then presents a
  framework for how people can think about big decisions that will affect their
  core beliefs, desires, and ultimately themselves, by modeling this as a
  decision process of choosing between different selves. Empirical evidence is
  used to refine different sub-models of this meta-reasoning process, including
  the asymmetric treatment of current and future utilities, the difference
  between future utilities and future beliefs, and a distance function between
  selves that is separate from considerations of future happiness.
