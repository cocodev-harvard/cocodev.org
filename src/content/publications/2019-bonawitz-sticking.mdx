abstract: "Constructing an intuitive theory from data confronts learners with a
  “chicken‐and‐egg” problem: The laws can only be expressed in terms of the
  theory's core concepts, but these concepts are only meaningful in terms of the
  role they play in the theory's laws; how can a learner discover appropriate
  concepts and laws simultaneously, knowing neither to begin with? We explore
  how children can solve this chicken‐and‐egg problem in the domain of
  magnetism, drawing on perspectives from computational modeling and behavioral
  experiments. We present 4‐ and 5‐year‐olds with two different simplified
  magnet‐learning tasks. Children appropriately constrain their beliefs to two
  hypotheses following ambiguous but informative evidence. Following a critical
  intervention, they learn the correct theory. In the second study, children
  infer the correct number of categories given no information about the possible
  causal laws. Children's hypotheses in these tasks are explained as rational
  inferences within a Bayesian computational framework."
