abstract: How do people understand the pragmatics of spatial language? We
  propose a rational-speech act model for spatial reasoning, and apply it to the
  terms 'in' and 'near'. We examine people's fine-grain spatial reasoning in
  this domain by having them locate where an event occurred, given an utterance.
  Our pragmatic listener model provides a quantitative and qualitative fit to
  people's inferences.
