abstract: Humans acquire their most basic physical concepts early in
  development, and continue to enrich and expand their intuitive physics
  throughout life as they are exposed to more and varied dynamical environments.
  We introduce a hierarchical Bayesian framework to explain how people can learn
  physical parameters at multiple levels. In contrast to previous Bayesian
  models of theory acquisition (Tenenbaum, Kemp, Griffiths, & Goodman, 2011), we
  work with more expressive *probabilistic program* representations suitable for
  learning the forces and properties that govern how objects interact in dynamic
  scenes unfolding over time. We compare our model to human learners on a
  challenging task of estimating multiple physical parameters in novel
  microworlds given short movies. This task requires people to reason
  simultaneously about multiple interacting physical laws and properties. People
  are generally able to learn in this setting and are consistent in their
  judgments. Yet they also make systematic errors indicative of the
  approximations people might make in solving this computationally demanding
  problem with limited computational resources. We propose two approximations
  that complement the top-down Bayesian approach. One approximation model relies
  on a more bottom-up feature-based inference scheme. The second approximation
  combines the strengths of the bottom-up and top-down approaches, by taking the
  feature-based inference as its point of departure for a search in
  physical-parameter space.
