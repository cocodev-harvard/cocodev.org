abstract: Recent progress in artificial intelligence has renewed interest in
  building systems that learn and think like people. Many advances have come
  from using deep neural networks trained end-to-end in tasks such as object
  recognition, video games, and board games, achieving performance that equals
  or even beats that of humans in some respects. Despite their biological
  inspiration and performance achievements, these systems differ from human
  intelligence in crucial ways. We review progress in cognitive science
  suggesting that truly human-like learning and thinking machines will have to
  reach beyond current engineering trends in both what they learn and how they
  learn it. Specifically, we argue that these machines should (1) build causal
  models of the world that support explanation and understanding, rather than
  merely solving pattern recognition problems; (2) ground learning in intuitive
  theories of physics and psychology to support and enrich the knowledge that is
  learned; and (3) harness compositionality and learning-to-learn to rapidly
  acquire and generalize knowledge to new tasks and situations. We suggest
  concrete challenges and promising routes toward these goals that can combine
  the strengths of recent neural network advances with more structured cognitive
  models.
