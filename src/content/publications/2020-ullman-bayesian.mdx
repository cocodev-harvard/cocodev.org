abstract: "A Bayesian framework helps to address, in computational terms, what
  knowledge children start with and how they construct and adapt models of the
  world during  childhood. Within this framework, inference over hierarchies of
  probabilistic generative programs in particular offers a normative and
  descriptivea ccount of children’s model-building. We consider two classic
  settings in which cognitive development has been framed as model-building: (i)
  Core knowledge in infancy, and (ii) The child as scientist. We interpret
  learning in both of these settings as resource-constrained, hierarchical
  Bayesian program induction with different primitives and constraints.
  We  examine what mechanisms children could use to meet the algorithmic
  challenges of navigating large spaces of potential models, in particular the
  proposal of “the child as hacker” and how it might be realized drawing on
  recent computational advances. We also discuss prospects for a unifying
  account of model building across scientific theories and intuitive theories,
  and in biological and cultural evolution more generally."
