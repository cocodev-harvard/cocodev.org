abstract: Our everyday decisions are driven by costs, risk, and reward. How do
  people take these factors into account when they predict and explain the
  decisions of others? In a two-part experiment, we assessed people’s
  perceptions of other people’s risk preferences, relative to their own. In Part
  1, participants reported their relative preference between a guaranteed payout
  and lotteries with various probabilities and payouts, and made predictions
  about other people’s preferences. In Part 2, participants estimated the
  lottery payout that generated a given relative preference between a guaranteed
  payout and a lottery, both for themselves and others. We found considerable
  individual variability in how people perceive the risk preferences of others
  relative to their own, and consistency in people’s perceptions across our two
  measures. Future directions include formal computational models and
  developmental studies of how we think about our own and each other’s
  decision-making.
