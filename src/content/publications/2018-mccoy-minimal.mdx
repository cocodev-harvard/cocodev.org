abstract: We introduce the Minimal Turing Test, an experimental paradigm for
  studying perceptions and meta-perceptions of different social groups or kinds
  of agents, in which participants must use a single word to convince a judge of
  their identity. We illustrate the paradigm by having participants act as
  contestants or judges in a Minimal Turing Test in which contestants must
  convince a judge they are a human, rather than an artificial intelligence. We
  embed the production data from such a large-scale Minimal Turing Test in a
  semantic vector space, and construct an ordering over pairwise evaluations
  from judges. This allows us to identify the semantic structure in the words
  that people give, and to obtain quantitative measures of the importance that
  people place on different attributes. Ratings from independent coders of the
  production data provide additional evidence for the agency and experience
  dimensions discovered in previous work on mind perception. We use the theory
  of Rational Speech Acts as a framework for interpreting the behavior of
  contestants and judges in the Minimal Turing Test.
