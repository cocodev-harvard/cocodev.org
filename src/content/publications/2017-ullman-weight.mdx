abstract: Languages commonly use physical properties to discuss non-physical
  states and events in the world. We investigate the degree to which human
  associations between physical properties and abstract concepts are culturally
  specific constructs. To do this, we tested three distinct populations---US
  adults, US children, and adults from an indigenous group in the lowlands of
  Bolivia, the Tsimane'---on their associations between the physical concept of
  weight, and a variety of abstract attributes (e.g., importance, emotional
  state, moral worth). We find a strong relationship between US and Tsimane'
  adults, but little-to-no relationship between US children and either adult
  population. This suggests that the concept of weight plays a similar role in
  everyday thought across cultures, but takes time to develop. We found that
  these associations could not be recovered from a simple semantic embedding
  analysis, suggesting that the cross-cultural connections between physical and
  abstract attributes may be learned through more than language alone.
