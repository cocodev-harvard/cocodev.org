title: "On the nature and origin of intuitive theories: Learning, physics and
  psychology"
date: 2015-01-01T00:00:00Z
abstract: his thesis develops formal computational models of intuitive theories,
  in particular intuitive physics and intuitive psychology, which form the basis
  of commonsense reasoning. The overarching formal framework is that of
  hierarchical Bayesian models, which see the mind as having domain-specific
  hypotheses about how the world works. The work first extends models of
  intuitive psychology to include higher-level social utilities, arguing against
  a pure 'classifier' view. Second, the work extends models of intuitive physics
  by introducing a ontological hierarchy of physics concepts, and examining how
  well people can reason about novel dynamic displays. I then examine the
  question of learning intuitive theories in general, arguing that an
  algorithmic approach based on stochastic search can address several puzzles of
  learning, including the 'chicken and egg' problem of concept learning.
  Finally, I argue the need for a joint theory-space for reasoning about
  intuitive physics and intuitive psychology, and provide such a simplified
  space in the form of a generative model for a novel domain called Lineland.
  Taken together, these results forge links between formal modeling, intuitive
  theories, and cognitive development.
