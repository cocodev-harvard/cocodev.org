abstract: In order to be held responsible, a person's action has to have made
  some sort of difference to the outcome. In this paper, we propose a
  counterfactual replacement model according to which people attribute
  responsibility by comparing their prior expectation about how an agent was
  going to act in a given situation, with their posterior expectation after
  having observed the agent's action. The model predicts blame if the posterior
  expectation is worse than the prior expectation and credit if it is better. In
  a novel experiment, we manipulate people's prior expectations by changing the
  framing of a structurally isomorphic task. As predicted by our counterfactual
  replacement model, people's prior expectations significantly influenced their
  responsibility attributions. We also show how our model can capture Johnson
  and Rips's (2013) findings that an agent is attributed less responsibility for
  bringing about a positive outcome when their action was suboptimal rather than
  optimal.
