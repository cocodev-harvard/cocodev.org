abstract: "Cushman's rationalization account can be extended to cover another
  part of his portrayal of representational exchange: thought experiments that
  lead to conclusions about the self. While Cushman's argument is compelling, a
  full account of rationalization as adaptive will need to account for the
  divergence in rationalizing one's actions compared to the actions of others."
