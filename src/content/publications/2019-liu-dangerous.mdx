abstract: Do infants appreciate that other people’s actions may fail, and that
  the possibility of failure endows risky actions with variable amounts of
  negative utility (hereafter, “peril”)? Three experiments addressed this
  question by presenting 10- and 13-month-old infants (N=124) with an agent who
  chose whether or not to jump over a trench of varying depth to reach two
  goals. At 13 months, infants expected the agent to minimize the potential
  negative consequences of actions, even though they never observed the agent
  fail to complete its action successfully. Moreover, they learned which goal
  the agent preferred by observing how much peril it risked to reach each goal.
  Although findings at 10 months were not clear, these findings provide evidence
  that 13-month-old infants represent danger as a kind of cost, possibly in an
  integrated utility calculus. They invite further study of infants’
  understanding of mental states and of counterfactual aspects of action.
