abstract: People make fast, spontaneous, and consistent judgements of social
  situations, even in complex physical contexts with multiple-body dynamics
  (e.g. pushing, lifting, carrying, etc.). What mental computations make such
  judgments possible? Do people rely on low-level perceptual cues, or on
  abstract concepts of agency, action, and force? We describe a new experimental
  paradigm, *Flatland*, for studying social inference in physical environments,
  using automatically generated interactive scenarios. We show that human
  interpretations of events in *Flatland* can be explained by a computational
  model that combines inverse hierarchical planning with a physical simulation
  engine to reason about objects and agents. This model outperforms cue-based
  alternatives based on hand-coded (multinomial logistic regression) and learned
  (LSTM) features. Our results suggest that humans could use a combination of
  intuitive physics and hierarchical planning to interpret complex interactive
  scenarios encountered in daily life.
