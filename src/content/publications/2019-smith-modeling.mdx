abstract: From infancy, humans have expectations about how objects will move and
  interact. Even young children expect objects not to move through one another,
  teleport, or disappear. They are surprised by mismatches between physical
  expectations and perceptual observations, even in unfamiliar scenes with
  completely novel objects. A model that exhibits human-like understanding of
  physics should be similarly surprised, and adjust its beliefs accordingly. We
  propose ADEPT, a model that uses a coarse (approximate geometry)
  object-centric representation for dynamic 3D scene understanding. Inference
  integrates deep recognition networks, extended probabilistic physical
  simulation, and particle filtering for forming predictions and expectations
  across occlusion. We also present a new test set for measuring violations of
  physical expectations, using a range of scenarios derived from developmental
  psychology. We systematically compare ADEPT, baseline models, and human
  expectations on this test set. ADEPT outperforms standard network
  architectures in discriminating physically implausible scenes, and often
  performs this discrimination at the same level as people. We will release all
  code and data.
