abstract: Evaluating individuals based on their pro- and anti-social behaviors
  is fundamental to successful human interaction. Recent research suggests that
  even preverbal infants engage in social evaluation; however, it remains an
  open question whether infants' judgments are driven uniquely by an analysis of
  the mental states that motivate others' helpful and unhelpful actions, or
  whether non-mentalistic inferences are at play. Here we present evidence from
  10-month-olds, motivated and supported by a Bayesian computational model, for
  mentalistic social evaluation in the first year of life. A video abstract of
  this article can be viewed at http://youtu.be/rD_Ry5oqCYE.
