abstract: We present the Neural Physics Engine (NPE), a framework for learning
  simulators of intuitive physics that naturally generalize across variable
  object count and different scene configurations. We propose a factorization of
  a physical scene into composable object-based representations and a neural
  network architecture whose compositional structure factorizes object dynamics
  into pairwise interactions. Like a symbolic physics engine, the NPE is endowed
  with generic notions of objects and their interactions; realized as a neural
  network, it can be trained via stochastic gradient descent to adapt to
  specific object properties and dynamics of different worlds. We evaluate the
  efficacy of our approach on simple rigid body dynamics in two-dimensional
  worlds. By comparing to less structured architectures, we show that the NPE's
  compositional representation of the structure in physical interactions
  improves its ability to predict movement, generalize across variable object
  count and different scene configurations, and infer latent properties of
  objects such as mass.
