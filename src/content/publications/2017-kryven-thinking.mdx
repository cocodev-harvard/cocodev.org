abstract: "Searching natural environments, as for example, when foraging or
  looking for a landmark, combines reasoning under uncertainty, planning and
  visual search. Existing paradigms for studying search in humans focus on
  step-by-step information sampling, without examining advance planning. We
  propose and evaluate a Bayesian model of how people search in a naturalistic
  maze-solving task. The model encodes environment exploration as a sequential
  process of acquiring information modeled by a Partially Observable Markov
  Decision Process (POMDP), which maximizes the information gained. We show that
  the search policy averaged across participants is optimal. Individual
  solutions, however, are highly variable and can be explained by two
  heuristics: thinking and guessing. Self-report and inference, a Gaussian
  Mixture Model over inverse POMDP, consistently assign most subjects to one
  style or the other. By analyzing individual participants' decision times we
  show that individuals solve partial POMDPs and plan their search a limited
  number of steps in advance."
