abstract: People have a common-sense notion of intelligence and use it to
  evaluate decisions and decision-makers. One can attribute intelligence by
  evaluating the strategy or the outcome of a goal-directed agent. We propose a
  model of intelligence attribution, based on inverse planning in Partially
  Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) in a probabilistic environment,
  inferring the most likely planning parameters given observed actions. The
  model explains the agent’s decisions by a combination of probabilistic
  planning, a softmax decision noise, prior knowledge about the world and
  forgetting, estimating the agent’s intelligence by a proxy measure of
  efficiently optimising costs and rewards. Behavioural evidence from two
  experiments shows that people cluster into those who attribute intelligence to
  the strategy and those who attribute intelligence to the outcome of the
  observed actions. People in the strategy cluster attribute more intelligence
  to decisions that minimise the agent’s overall cost, even if the outcome is
  unlucky. People in the outcome cluster attribute intelligence to the outcome,
  judging low-cost outcomes as a sign of intelligence even if the outcome is
  accidental and make neutral judgements before they observe the result. Our
  model explains human intelligence judgements better than perceptual cues such
  as the number of revisits or moves.
