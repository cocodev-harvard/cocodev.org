abstract: Infants understand that people pursue goals, but how do they learn
  which goals people prefer? We tested whether infants solve this problem by
  inverting a mental model of action planning, trading off the costs of acting
  against the rewards actions bring. After seeing an agent attain two goals
  equally often at varying costs, infants expected the agent to prefer the goal
  it attained through costlier actions. These expectations held across three
  experiments that conveyed cost through different physical path features
  (height, width, and incline angle), suggesting that an abstract variable—such
  as “force,” “work,” or “effort”—supported infants’ inferences. We modeled
  infants’ expectations as Bayesian inferences over utility-theoretic
  calculations, providing a bridge to recent quantitative accounts of action
  understanding in older children and adults.
