abstract: The very early appearance of abstract knowledge is often taken as
  evidence for innateness. We explore the relative learning speeds of abstract
  and specific knowledge within a Bayesian framework, and the role for innate
  structure. We focus on knowledge about causality, seen as a domain-general
  intuitive theory, and ask whether this knowledge can be learned from
  cooccurrence of events. We begin by phrasing the causal Bayes nets theory of
  causality, and a range of alternatives, in a logical language for relational
  theories. This allows us to explore simultaneous inductive learning of an
  abstract theory of causality and a causal model for each of several causal
  systems. We find that the correct theory of causality can be learned
  relatively quickly, often becoming available before specific causal theories
  have been learned â€“ an effect we term the blessing of abstraction. We then
  explore the effect of providing a variety of auxiliary evidence, and find that
  a collection of simple "perceptual input analyzers" can help to bootstrap
  abstract knowledge. Together these results suggest that the most efficient
  route to causal knowledge may be to build in not an abstract notion of
  causality, but a powerful inductive learning mechanism and a variety of
  perceptual supports. While these results are purely computational, they have
  implications for cognitive development, which we explore in the conclusion.
