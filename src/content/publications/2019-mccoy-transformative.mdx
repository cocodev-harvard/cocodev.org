abstract: In this commentary we engage with Paulâ€™s *Transformative Experience*
  as it relates to decision making. We consider why deciding whether to undergo
  a transformative experiences can feel so agonizing yet also be so fun, whether
  people have any preferences to decide over in the first place, and who people
  even think they are.
