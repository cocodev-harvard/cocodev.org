abstract: We explore the hypothesis that many intuitive physical inferences are
  based on a mental physics engine that is analogous in many ways to the machine
  physics engines used in building interactive video games. We describe the key
  features of game physics engines and their parallels in human mental
  representation, focusing especially on the intuitive physics of young infants
  where the hypothesis helps to unify many classic and otherwise puzzling
  phenomena, and may provide the basis for a computational account of how the
  physical knowledge of infants develops. This hypothesis also explains several
  ‘physics illusions’,and helps to inform the development of artificial
  intelligence (AI) systems with more human-like common sense.
