abstract: People spend much of their time in imaginary worlds, and have beliefs
  about the events that are likely in those worlds, and the laws that govern
  them. Such beliefs are likely affected by people’s intuitive theories of the
  real world. In three studies, people judged the effort required to cast spells
  that cause physical violations. People ranked the actions of spells
  congruently with intuitive physics. For example, people judge that it requires
  more effort to conjure up a frog than to levitate it one foot off the ground.
  A second study manipulated the target and extent of the spells, and
  demonstrated with a continuous measure that people are sensitive to this
  manipulation even between participants. A pre-registered third study
  replicated the results of Study 2. These results suggest that people’s
  intuitive theories partly account for how they think about imaginary worlds.
