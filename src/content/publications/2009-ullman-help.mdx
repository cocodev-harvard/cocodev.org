abstract: "Everyday social interactions are heavily influenced by our snap
  judgments about others goals. Even young infants can infer the goals of
  intentional agents from observing how they interact with objects and other
  agents in their environment: e.g., that one agent is helping or hindering
  anothers attempt to get up a hill or open a box. We propose a model for how
  people can infer these social goals from actions, based on inverse planning in
  multiagent Markov decision problems (MDPs). The model infers the goal most
  likely to be driving an agents behavior by assuming the agent acts
  approximately rationally given environmental constraints and its model of
  other agents present. We also present behavioral evidence in support of this
  model over a simpler, perceptual cue-based alternative."
