bio: I am interested in using methods from cognitive science, neuroscience, and
  computational modeling to understand the mechanisms behind common-sense
  reasoning, the underlying representations of abstract concepts, and the
  operations that build our compositional thoughts.

I am interested in using methods from cognitive science, neuroscience, and computational modeling to understand the mechanisms behind common-sense reasoning, the underlying representations of abstract concepts, and the operations that build our compositional thoughts. My current project is to study what object representations people use for understanding intuitive physics.
