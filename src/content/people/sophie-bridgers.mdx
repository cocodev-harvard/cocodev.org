bio: How do humans intuitively understand what other people want? How do we
  navigate the tension between our own and others' needs in social interactions?
  I use developmental experiments and computational models to characterize how
  humans grasp and respond to others' goals, and how one’s own utility can
  affect interpretation of others’ goals, at times leading to successful
  cooperation and at other times leading to misunderstandings, searching for
  loopholes, and rule-bending.

I am a postdoctoral fellow with the Simons Center for the Social Brain at MIT, working with Dr. Tomer Ullman (Harvard) and Dr. Laura Schulz (MIT). I completed my PhD in Psychology at Stanford University, where I worked with Hyowon Gweon, and a B.A. in Cognitive Science at UC Berkeley. I am broadly interested in how we make decisions with others' goals in mind. In my PhD, I studied the social cognitive mechanisms of prosocial decision-making in early childhood. In my postdoc, I am exploring how humans intuitively understand others' goals and navigate the tensions between their own and others' needs. In particular, I am looking at how one's own utility affects interpretation of others' goals, leading to misunderstandings, searching for loopholes, rule-bending, and related behavior. I use behavioral experiments with children and adults, as well as computational models to gain traction on these questions.
