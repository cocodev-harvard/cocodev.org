title: "A Note to All"
---

The Computation, Cognition, and Development Lab values diversity of all kinds. We strive
to provide enriching opportunities for all trainees, including those from marginalized
and historically disadvantaged backgrounds. We are committed to increasing the
representation of trainees from diverse backgrounds and ensuring that our field
represents the values, perspectives, and experiences of a wider range of students and
trainees. As such, we welcome and encourage applications from trainees who identify as
members of marginalized or historically disadvantaged groups and work to provide a
training environment that supports the needs of all students. We are committed to
fostering a safe and supportive community in which all members are able to contribute
fully regardless of age, gender, race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, gender
identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, or any other applicable basis.

We expect all of our members to behave in ways that promote the supportive and
productive exchange of ideas, treating all individuals equitably and with respect.
