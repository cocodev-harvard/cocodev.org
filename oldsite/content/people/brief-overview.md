The _Computation, Cognition, and Development Lab_ is at the center of cognitive
science, developmental psychology, and artificial intelligence. **We investigate
the common-sense knowledge people have about the world, where it comes from,
and how it develops throughout childhood.**

_To do this, we use a combination of behavioral, developmental, and computational
methods to pursue these topics._

Our guiding metaphor is that of _program induction_, and the mind as learning, 
generating, and running different _probabilistic programs_. Seen through this
lens, our question becomes: **what is the initial start-up library of useful 
programs that children (and other intelligent agents) might use to reliably
learn and reason about the world around them?**
