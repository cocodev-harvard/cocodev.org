bio: My research focuses on the structure and origin of knowledge, guided by
  perspectives and methods from cognitive science, cognitive development, and
  computational modeling. By combining these, I hope to better understand the
  form and development of the basic commonsense reasoning that guides our
  interaction with the world and the people in it.

Tomer Ullman is a cognitive scientist interested in common-sense reasoning, and
building computational models for explaining high-level cognitive processes and
the acquisition of new knowledge by children and adults. In particular, he is
focused on how children and adults come to form intuitive theories of agents and
objects, and providing both a functional and algorithmic account of how these
theories are learned. Such an account would go a long way towards explaining the
basics cogs and springs of human intelligence, and support the building of more
human-like artificial intelligence. Dr. Ullman received in B.Sc in Cognitive
Science and Physics from Hebrew University in 2008, and his Ph.D. in Brain and
Cognitive Sciences from MIT in 2015. From 2015-2018 he was a post-doctoral
associate at the Center for Brains, Minds, and Machines.

Dr. Ullman's research has been funded by the National Science Foundation, and
the Center for Brains, Minds, and Machines.
